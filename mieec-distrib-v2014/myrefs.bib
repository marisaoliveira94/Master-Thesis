	abstract = {Important design considerations require that multi-clock designs be carefully constructed at Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) boundaries. This paper details some of the latest strategies and best known methods to address passing of one and multiple signals across a CDC boundary. Included in the paper are techniques related to CDC verification and an interesting 2-deep FIFO design for passing multiple control signals between clock domains. Although the design methods described in the paper can be generally implemented using any HDL, the examples are shown using efficient SystemVerilog techniques.},

@article{R028,
	abstract = {This document explains CRCs (Cyclic Redundancy Codes) and their table-driven implementations in full, precise detail. Much of the literature on CRCs, and in particular on their table-driven implementations, is a little obscure (or at least seems so to me). This document is an attempt to provide a clear and simple no-nonsense explanation of CRCs and to absolutely nail down every detail of the operation of their high-speed implementations. In addition to this, this document presents a parameterized model CRC algorithm called the "Rocksoft{\^{}}tm Model CRC Algorithm". The model algorithm can be parameterized to behave like most of the CRC implementations around, and so acts as a good reference for describing particular algorithms. A low-speed implementation of the model CRC algorithm is provided in the C programming language. Lastly there is a section giving two forms of high-speed table driven implementations, and providing a program that generates CRC lookup tables.},

	abstract = {High-speed serial I/O can be used to solve system interconnect design challenges. Such I/Os, when integrated into a highly programmable digital environment such as an FPGA, allow you to create high-performance designs that were never possible before. This book discusses the many aspects of high-speed serial designs with real world examples of how to implement working designs, including: ■ Basic I/O Concepts – Differential signaling, System Synchronous, and Source Synchronous design techniques. ■ Pros and Cons of different implemenations – How to evaluate the cost advantages, the reduced EMI, the maximum data flow, and so on. ■ SERDES Design – Basic theory, how to implement highly efficient serial to parallel channels, coding schemes, and so on. ■ Design Considerations – Standard and custom protocols, signal integrity, impedance, shielding, and so on. ■ Testing – Interpreting eye patterns, reducing jitter, interoperability considerations, bit error testers, and so on.},
